# Excel-Projects

## Introduction 
This project explores loan application data using Microsoft Excel with the goal of understanding lending patterns and classifying loans as “good” or “bad.” It involves cleaning and preparing the dataset, applying transformations in Power Query, and creating calculated measures to analyze loan performance. The project serves as a hands-on exercise in Excel-based data analysis, focusing on practical use of formulas, queries, and pivot reporting. This repository contains the necessary files and Excel files along with the Dashboards.
